/**
@defgroup data_source DataSource
\brief This module contains the core of the simulator: the DataSource,
SignalContainer, Parameter & DataSourceModule interface.

\details
The following concepts are used:
- Signal: information stored in the DataSource (more precisely in the SignalContainer)
- Module: class that calculates signals (which we call its outputs) based on the
values of other signals (which we call its inputs)
- System: set of related signals and modules. A system is not, as such, represented
by any single class: it is an abstraction that arises from naming signals as
belonging to a certain system.

\subsection Types 
The basic underlying types are:
- DataSource
- SignalContainer

\subsection Algorithms
The implemented algorithms are:
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_chaining">Forward-chaining</a> (simplified Rete algorithm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm)
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_chaining">Backward-chaining</a>
