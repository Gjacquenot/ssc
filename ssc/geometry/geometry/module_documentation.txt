This module is a simple wrapper around Boost.geometry and libGeographic.
This module's API is provided by the following classes:

\subsection Types 
The basic underlying types are:
- LongitudeLatitude: position on the globe (in spherical, Cartesian or geographical coordinates)
- Angle: conversion between various angle units

\subsection Algorithms
The implemented algorithms are:
- Track: determine the length of a track or find a point on a track
- PointInCartesianPolygon: test if a point lies in a polygon on the earth surface, defined in Cartesian coordinates
- PointInSphericalPolygon: test if a point lies in a polygon on the earth surface, defined in spherical coordinates
- PointInGeographicalPolygon: test if a point lies in a polygon on the earth surface, defined on the WGS84
