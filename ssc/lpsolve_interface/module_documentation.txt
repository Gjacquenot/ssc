/**
@defgroup optimize_speed Speed optimization
\brief Provides tools to compute an optimal speed given certain waypoints: start & end times
are fixed, but there can be intermediate points (with no specified dates).


\subsection external_types External types
These types constitute the API of the module.
- OptimizeSpeedOnTrack: this is the entry point (highest level functionality)
- SpeedRetriever: this is the type returned when optimizing speed. It allows us to retrieve the speed at any instant & any point on the Track
- SplitInTwo: subclass of SplitTrackOptimally used for testing purposes (always splits a track in two subtracks of equal length)
- SplitTrackOptimally: Generic interface to split tracks in two subtracks of equal duration, according to a certain criterion
- Time: wrapper around double but checks value is positive at construction
- TrackTime: Subclass of Track adding departure & arrival time information
- Weather: stores weather information for the environmental models
- WeatherModule: interface describing how the weather data is to be retrieved

\subsection internal_types Internal types
These types are not exposed in the API.
- SpeedAtWayPoint: stores a position & a speed information together
- SpeedAtWayPointExtractor: facilitates the creation of OptimalSpeedRetriever objects
- TrackToSpeedRetriever: converts a vector of Track to a SpeedRetriever
<<<<<<< HEAD
- ShipModel: calculates the ship's propulsion power given thruster states
- Allocator: calculates thruster states given certain weather conditions, a ship speed & a heading
- TrackCost: computes the cost (CO, NOx, etc.) on a track at a given time or on the whole track

\subsection algorithms Algorithms
The route is given (eg. by a dedicated routing software or by the mission preparation
module). We only optimize the speed without taking into account the route/speed
coupling. This makes the resolution much easier but it is necessarily an approximate
solution. It also allows us to separate the implementation in two independent modules
(optimize trajectory & optimize speed).
